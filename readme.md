# Immersive Media Pocket Reference
This site is a work-in-progress document for collecting knowledge about VR.

## Project Goals
1. Formally act as a glossary of terms for immersive media technology.
2. Collect and organize resources, links, and more to serve as a convenient gateway to existing information.

## Who did this
This currently just a side project by Hunter Dyar, me. I teach Immersive Media at Chatham University and was writing a glossary for my intro course when I thought "lets just put this out there". This is the very beginnings of that, and should still serve as a course reference guide in the meantime.

## How the site works
This site is currently hosted through GitHub Pages with the [Just The Docs](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/) theme. Students - or anyone - will be to use pull requests through git to contribute. One could also raise an Issue through github's issues system.
