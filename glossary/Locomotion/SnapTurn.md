# Snap Turn
The players ability to rotate the virtual world around them in relation their real world. Tends to be disorienting, but sometimes essential. Often implemented to work with non full-360 6dof tracking solutions, like the PSVR, and is helpful for accessibility. 

While it can be helpful for such accessibility situations, design wise, turning does a lot to remove presence, and can be severely disorienting. Like the 30 degree rule in film-editing, moving to a new location - but not *that* new of a location can be more disorienting than teleporting somewhere new entirely.
