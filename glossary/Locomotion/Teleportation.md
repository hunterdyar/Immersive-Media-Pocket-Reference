# Teleportation
Teleportation is the conceptually simplest form of locomotion. You select a new location to go, and then you instantly jump to that location.

Teleportation can weaken the feeling of presence.


## Granular Teleportation
The user can "go anywhere". Pros: easy to implement. Cons: hard to pick the correct spot. It is also difficult for the user to know where they are in the real world, while still requiring them to be obliquely aware of such information. 

Granular teleportation discourages physical movement. Players tend to just keep teleporting, which is immersion-breaking and makes building presence difficult.

With granular teleportation, some users find a way to get themselves stuck with a disconnection between virtual and real spaces. For example, I have gotten myself into a situation where the real-world wall was right in front of me, and a virtual wall was right behind me. I found it difficult to break my virtual presense and walk through the virtual wall in order to try and reset myself.

One method for tackling such troubling and immersion-breaking moments is to show the player an outline of their play-area space while teleporting. While this does helps, it asks the player to be aware of their real-world space at all times. I think it is a good idea to let such an outline be enabled in the settings, or only enable it if the player is teleporting a few times in the same area in quick succession, as they may likely need the assistance.

## Zone-Based Teleportation
Zone based teleportation allows you to select new "rooms" or zones to teleport to, but those zones are linked to your play area, not your feet position.

In other words, you are moving your real play area to discrete and pre-defined spots in the virtual world. From each zone, you then interact within your play area space.

Zone-based teleportation is easy for the user to understand and it keeps player away from real-world walls or from over-relying on teleportation, allowing presnece to be build more easily. It is generally more difficult to design for and implement, especially in a situation where your level was not designed for VR, like an architecure sim or port of a video game.
