# Standing Only
Constrasting with [Room Scale](Room-Scale.md), Standing-only VR is a VR design pattern that only lets the user experience it from one main perspective point. It can be 6DOF or 3DOF.

Some room-scale experiences give you enough locomotion/teleportation options that you do not need to move your feet to participate in the experience. They would still be considered "room-scale".

## Examples of Standing Only experiences
- Cubism
- WITHIN
- Beat-Saber (sort of)

# Seated VR
Similar to Standing VR, seated VR experiences can be experienced while sitting in a chair. 

If you do not need to be able to complete a 360 rotation (like on a swivel stool), this can be considered "[Toilet Ready](ToiletReady.md)" VR.
