# Room-Scale
Room-scale VR is (Generally 6DOF) a VR design pattern that allows the viewer to move around in a roughly room-sized environment. 

It’s a broadly-used term. Some say “room scale” when they mean to say “6DOF”, but I hold that “room scale” is a design term, while 6DOF is a technology term. 

You can use a 6DOF VR headset but still experience non room-scale experiences.

Room-scale refers to experiences where you do not have to teleport, or use another form of locomotion. That said, many developers still implement such things in order to better accomidate a wide variety of VR setup sizes, "just in case", or use minimal teleportation to move between rooms where the major interaction takes place.
