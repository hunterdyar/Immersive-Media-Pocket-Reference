# Latency

A delay. Without more context, “latency” will refer to the time between moving, and having that movement appear represented in the VR environment – on the screen. Low enough latency goes completely unnoticed while high latency is a major cause of motion sickness. Causes of Latency include tracking time, computer processing time (i.e.: game physics), graphics rendering time, screen refresh rates, and more.

Latency is bad, a probably source of headaches and motion sickness.
