# Locomotion

Locomotion still means what it always means: The act of moving from one place to another.

In VR, we often talk about locomotion, particularly when the VR experience gives the user the ability to move greater distances than their real-world environment would allow (ie: by simply walking).

“Simply walking” is, however, the simplest form of virtual locomotion.
 
## Common forms of Virtual Locomotion
- Sliding around by controller input.
- Moving Platforms/non-user-directed virtual movement
- Teleportation
- Redirected walking

Beware motion sickness.
