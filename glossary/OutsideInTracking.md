# Outside-In Tracking

Outside-In tracking is tracking technology where there are external sensors (positioned “outside” looking “in”) that track an objects position. The HTC Vive ‘lighthouses’ and Oculus Rift sensors are examples of outside-in tracking. The advantages tend to be high quality tracking. The external sensors should be static and generally need free line-of-sight to the subject. Frequently, we mount these sensors high up on a wall.
