# Tracking

Tracking refers to the technological process of determining where an object is in the real world – and more importantly – how it is moving and rotating in real time. 

For VR real-world position (or “location”, ie: GPS tracking) is less important than relative tracking. That is, getting the object’s movement correct, and doing it as close to real-time as possible.
