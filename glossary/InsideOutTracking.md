# Inside-Out Tracking

Inside-out tracking is technology for determining a headsets rotation and/or position is contained within the headset. Accelerometers and gyroscopes, for example. With inside-out tracking, there is no need for external sensors. The advantages tend to be ease of use, and the flexibility to not have an established space.
